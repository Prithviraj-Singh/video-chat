# Video Chat
This is a repository for a video chat app created using python

### Libraries:
* OpenCV
* NumPy
* Socket

### Code:
The code for both the client and the server is the same, you just need to update the IP adress and the port number for your computer and the peer's computer. Don't try to increase the size of the images that you are sending unless you know how to increase the buffer send and buffer recieve size.
